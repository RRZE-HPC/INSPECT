  review: orange
  comment: Ivy Bridge and Sandy Bridge have problems with splitloads and small stencils containing a central point. This issue was raised to Intel, but no solution was offered. As of Haswell, the problem is resolved. Including `#pragma vector aligned` reduced the problem, but does not solve it completly. Removing the central point solves this issue.
