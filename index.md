# {{site.title}}

The [stempel](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/stempel) tool allows automatic generation of loop kernels for several kind of stencil patterns. Stempel provides a framework to generate, perform static analysis of the code (exploiting kerncraft), generate a full C code and parallelize it via openMP and blocking.

On this site a collection of benchmark data obtained from the [stempel](https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/stempel) tool can be found.

Machine descriptions can be found [here](machinefiles).

Information on how to perform reproducible performance benchmarks, can be found on [this page](reproducibility).
